In this blog post I'll show you how to deploy a simple _Quarkus_ application to _Azure_ using _Terraform_, thanks to _NubesGen_.

This is the first blog post of a series of three on Quarkus and NubesGen:

* How to Deploy a Quarkus Application to Azure with Terraform Thanks to NubesGen
* How to Deploy a Quarkus Application to Azure with GitHub Actions Thanks to NubesGen
* How to Deploy a JHipster Quarkus Application to Azure Thanks to NubesGen

You can watch this Quarkus Tip that summarises what's covered in this series of blog posts:

== What's Covered in This Blog Post?

To break it into more details, these are the topics that will be covered in this blog post:

* What is _Terraform_?
* What is _NubesGen_?
* Generate a basic _Quarkus_ REST endpoint.
* Package the Quarkus application in an Uber Jar.
* Use NubesGen to generate Terraform templates.
* Use Terraform to deploy the Quarkus application to Azure.
* Check the deployed application.

=== Use Case

The goal of this blog post is to focus on Terraform, Azure and NubesGen.
So the idea is to develop a very simple REST endpoint that says _hello_ (yet another hello world).
This REST endpoint is packaged into a Uber JAR and deployed on Azure thanks to Terraform.

=== Prerequisites

To follow along and be able to execute the code samples, you will need the following tools installed on your machine:

* JDK 11 and Maven (Quarkus also supports Gradle if you pref)
* https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/install-azure-cli[Azure CLI] (`brew install azure-cli` to install on Mac)
* https://www.terraform.io/docs/cli/commands/index.html[Terraform CLI]  (`brew tap hashicorp/tap & brew install hashicorp/tap/terraform` on Mac)
* https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/free/[Have an Azure subscription]

== What is Terraform?

But first, let me introduce https://learn.hashicorp.com/terraform[Terraform].
Terraform is an Open Source tool for provisioning and managing infrastructures.
This can be cloud or on-premise infrastructure.
As stated on their website, Terraform is an infrastructure as code (IaC) tool to _"build, change, version and destroy infrastructure safely and efficiently"_.
The idea is to define what your infrastructure will look like and let Terraform
you describe your overall topology (network, security group roles, virtual machines, load balancers).
And the topology of your application might change overtime:
you might add firewalls, dns, CDN, monitoring
you incrementally evolve your infrastructure
The way to define your infrastructure is by using code.
This way, you can easily read it, change it, store it within your code, version it, etc.
A Terraform template (or terraform configuration) is written in ... language, which is human readable, and looks like this

Terraform then, based on the configuration, gives us a workflow to creating and managing

=== Terraform Workflow

As a resource topology becomes complex, understanding the meaning and impact of infrastructure changes can be difficult.

* refresh: reconciles the way Terraform thinks the infrastructure looks like, with the real world.
It checks with the Cloud provider what's running at the moment, it gets an up to date view of what the infrastructure actually is
* plan: Terraform figures out what it needs to do. Reconciling what's acutally running, with what we want to be running (the disered configuration)
* apply: Terraform actually does the job, and applies the needed changes to go from what's running to the disired state
* destroy: Destroys all the components

=== Terraform Internal Architecture

The way Terraform is architecture is with:

* a core: is the one dealing with the lifecycle. It takes the configuration, takes the desired state, but then it delegates to providers
* a set of providers: IaaS cloud (AWS, Azure, GCP), on premisee infrastructure (Open stack, VM Ware), PaaS (Heroku, Kubernetes), to SaaS (DataDog, Fastly, Github Teams)

=== Terraform And Azure

Terraform can an infrastructure across multiple cloud providers.
It's just a matter for this cloud provider to provide the right Terraform modules

== What is NubesGen?

There are several ways to deploy a Java application to Azure.
You can use the https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/install-azure-cli[Azure command line], the https://portal.azure.com/#home[Azure admin console], ..., or Terraform.
As we've just seen, Terraform has several advantages, but writing the templates can be a bit tricky.
You need to know Terraform, but more important, you need to know the Az
That's what NubesGen is there for:
generate the Terraform templates for you.

NubesGen is an open source project that was initiated in 2021.
It lets you generate Terraform templates either using a web interface or curl commands.
For example, if you want to generate Terraform templates for a Quarkus application, you can go to https://xxx[www] and choose Quarkus from the combobox.

You can also specify the region, if the application needs a database, a Redis cache or...
This will download a zip file containing the generated templates that you can add to your project.

If, like me, you prefer the command line, NubesGen allows you to download these template throught a curl command.
Downloading throught the Web interface or the command line results in the same templates.

Let's see NubesGen in action.

== Generating a Simple Quarkus Application

First of all, let's generate a simple Quarkus application.
This application exposes a RestEndpoint that says "Hello NubesGen".
Nothing too fancy, but this allows us to focus on the deployment, not the code.

=== Bootstrapping a Quarkus Application

Go to https://xxx[code.quarkus.io], specify your project name, group and artifact id, and select the Rest Easy extension.
Download the Zip file.
This is what you should have:

.Maven command to bootstrap a Quarkus application
[source,bash]
----
include::{code-github-url}/bootstrap.sh[tag=adocSnippet]
----

Now, to execute it, type `mvn quarkus:dev`.
Once Quarkus is up and ready, invoke the endpoint pointing at the URL ``.

=== Updating the Generated Code

.Rest Endpoint
[source,java]
----
include::{code-github-url}/src/main/java/org/agoncal/article/nubesgen/terraform/GreetingResource.java[tag=adocSnippet]
----

.Testing the Rest Endpoint
[source,java]
----
include::{code-github-url}/src/test/java/org/agoncal/article/nubesgen/terraform/GreetingResourceTest.java[tag=adocSnippet]
----

=== Packaging the Application

We've just executed Quarkus in development mode.
What we need now is to package the application.
Quarkus has different ways of packaging an application:
as a Docker image, a native binary (thanks to GraalVM) or as an executable JAR.
Let's go for this option now, it's simple and portable.

To get a Uber-JAR of the application, execute the following command:

[source,bash]
----
$ mvn package
----

=== Executing the Application

To run the application is just a matter of executing:

[source,bash]
----
$ mvn package
----

== Generating the Terraform Templates with NubesGen

We have a simple application, with no database, no authentication, nothing, packaged in an executable Uber-JAR.
Let's ask NubesGen to generate the Terraform templates.

=== Application Terraform Template

== Deploying to Azure

=== Executing the Terraform Templates

=== Checking with the Azure Console

=== Checking with the Azure CLI

== Conclusion

Terraform can be tricky.
Its language is simple, but because Terraforma has an extension mecanism, its ecosystem is huge.
You can find extension for Java, for AWS, for GCP... and for Azure.
Deploying to the cloud, even a simple application, can take you a few lines of code to write.

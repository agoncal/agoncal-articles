In the previous blog post we manually deployed a _Quarkus_ application to _Azure_ using the Azure Maven plugin and a set of _Terraform_ configuration files.
In this blog post, we will use _GitHub Actions_ to automatically build and deploy this application to Azure.
So I'll show you how to deploy a simple _Quarkus_ application to _Azure_ using _Terraform_ and _GitHub Actions_, thanks to _NubesGen_.

== What's Covered in This Blog Post?

To break it into more details, these are the topics that will be covered in this blog post:

* What is _GitHub Actions_?
* Generate a basic _Quarkus_ REST endpoint.
* Use _NubesGen_ to generate Terraform configuration files for a simple Quarkus application.
* Use _NubesGen_ to generate _Github Actions_ so we can automatically deploy the application.
* Use _Github Actions_ to automatically build and deploy the Quarkus application to Azure.
* Check the deployed application on Azure.

If you don't know what _Terraform_ or _NubesGen_ are, you should check my first blog post _"How to Manually Deploy a Quarkus Application to Azure with Terraform Thanks to NubesGen"_.

=== Use Case

The goal of this blog post is to focus on using _Github Actions_ and _Terraform_, to automatically build and deploy a Quarkus application and its infrastructure to _Azure_ thanks to _NubesGen_.
The idea is to use Quarkus to develop a very simple REST endpoint that says _hello_ (yet another hello world).
Then, we will generate Github Actions files so it can automatically get packaged and deployed each time we push the code to Github.

=== Prerequisites

To code along and be able to execute the code samples, you will need the following tools installed on your machine:

* An IDE, JDK 11 and Maven (Quarkus also supports Gradle if you prefer)
* https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/free/[Have an Azure subscription]
* http://github.com/[Have a GitHub account]
* https://curl.se/[cURL]

== What Is GitHub Actions?

But first, let me introduce GitHub Actions.

GitHub Actions makes it easy to automate all your software workflows, now with world-class CI/CD. Build, test, and deploy your code right from GitHub.

Automate, customize, and execute your software development workflows right in your repository with GitHub Actions. You can discover, create, and share actions to perform any job you'd like, including CI/CD, and combine actions in a completely customized workflow.

If you take the basic Github flow (feature branch)

Uses Yaml syntax to define the events, jobs or steps.
This files must be located under `.github/workflows` at the root of your project.
The language being agnostic, you can build, test and publish accross mulitple languages, operating systems, plateforms.

You also have the ability to create your own actions but there are also pre-built actions (found on the https://github.com/marketplace[Github Market Place])


=== Feature Branch Workflows

Github Actions is even based.
This means that there are https://docs.github.com/en/actions/reference/events-that-trigger-workflows[several events] you can listen to and act

=== Events, Jobs and Steps

[source,yaml]
----
# Triggered when code is pushed to any branch in a repository
on: push
----

[source,yaml]
----
# Triggered when code is pushed to a branch called `env` something
on:
  push:
    branches:
      - 'env-*'

== Generating a Simple Quarkus Application

First of all, let's generate a simple Quarkus application.
This application exposes a RestEndpoint that says "Hello NubesGen".
Nothing too fancy, but this allows us to focus on the deployment, not the code.

=== Bootstrapping a Quarkus Application

Go to https://xxx[code.quarkus.io], specify your project name, group and artifact id, and select the Rest Easy extension.
Download the Zip file.
This is what you should have:

```
code
```

Now, to execute it, type `mvn quarkus:dev`.
Once Quarkus is up and ready, invoke the endpoint pointing at the URL ``.

=== Updating the Generated Code

Let's change the generated code so our REST endpoint returns _Hello NubesGen_ with a timestamp:

.Rest Endpoint
[source,java]
----
include::{code-github-url}/src/main/java/org/agoncal/article/nubesgen/githubactions/GreetingResource.java[tag=adocSnippet]
----

And if we want the tests to pass, it's just a matter of changing the RESTAssured test:

.Testing the Rest Endpoint
[source,java]
----
include::{code-github-url}src/test/java/org/agoncal/article/nubesgen/githubactions/GreetingResourceTest.java[tag=adocSnippet]
----

That's enough business code, time to package and deploy the application.

=== Testing and Executing the Application

Now that we have built the executable JAR, running the application is just a matter of executing:

[source,bash]
----
$ java -jar target/quarkus-nubesgen-terraform-1.0.0-SNAPSHOT-runner.jar
----

Once Quarkus is up and running, execute the following cURL command, you should see our _Hello NubesGen_:

[source,bash]
----
$ curl http://localhost:8080/hello

Hello NubesGen 2021-07-07T14:21:54.314396Z
----

== Generating the Terraform and GitHub Actions Configuration Files with NubesGen

We have a simple application, with no database, no authentication, nothing, packaged in an executable Uber-JAR.
Let's ask NubesGen to generate the Terraform templates.

.Generating Terraform and GitHub Actions Files with a cURL Command
[source,bash]
----
$ curl "https://nubesgen.com/quarkus-nubesgen-github-actions.tgz?iactool=TERRAFORM&region=northeurope&application=APP_SERVICE.free&runtime=QUARKUS&database=NONE.free&gitops=true" | tar -xzvf -
----

=== Terraform Configuration Files

=== GitHub Action Files

== Automatically Deploying the Application

=== Providing the Infrastructure

=== Packaging the Application

=== Deploying the Application

== Checking the Deployed Application on Azure

First of all, we need to check if our REST endpoint is responding.
For that, we use the URL that was displayed once the plan executed, and add our `hello` path:

[source,bash]
----
$ curl https://app-quarkus-nubesgen-terraform-001.azurewebsites.net/hello
----

Good!
The REST endpoint replies _Hello NubesGen_, so it's up and running.
Let's check the Azure console.

=== Checking the Azure Console

If you want to have a look at what's deployed, one way is to go to the Azure portal.
For that, go to https://portal.azure.com and check the resources.
You should see the application as well as the plan:

=== Checking with the Azure CLI

== Conclusion

Terraform can be tricky.
Its language is simple, but because Terraforma has an extension mecanism, its ecosystem is huge.
You can find extension for Java, for AWS, for GCP... and for Azure.
Deploying to the cloud, even a simple application, can take you a few lines of code to write.

In this blog post, I'll show you how to deploy a simple _Quarkus_ application to _Azure_ using _Terraform_ and _GitHub Actions_, thanks to _NubesGen_.

//This is the first blog post of a series of three on Quarkus and NubesGen:

== What's Covered in This Blog Post?

To break it into more details, these are the topics that will be covered in this blog post:

* What is _GitHub Actions_?
* Use NubesGen to generate Terraform templates for a simple Quarkus application.
* Use NubesGen to generate _Git Actions_ so you can get CI/CD.
* How to deploy a Quarkus application to Azure.

If you don't know what _Terraform_ or _NubesGen_, you should check my first blog post "How to Manually Deploy a Quarkus Application to Azure with Terraform Thanks to NubesGen".

=== Use Case

The goal of this blog post is to focus on _Terraform_, _Azure_ and _NubesGen_.
So the idea is to use Quarkus to develop a very simple REST endpoint that says _hello_ (yet another hello world).
Then we will package this REST endpoint into an Uber-JAR and deploy it on Azure thanks to Terraform and the Azure Maven plugin.

=== Prerequisites

To code along and be able to execute the code samples, you will need the following tools installed on your machine:

* JDK 11 and Maven (Quarkus also supports Gradle if you prefer)
* https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/install-azure-cli[Azure CLI] (`brew install azure-cli` to install on Mac)
* https://www.terraform.io/docs/cli/commands/index.html[Terraform CLI]  (`brew tap hashicorp/tap & brew install hashicorp/tap/terraform` on Mac)
* https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/free/[Have an Azure subscription]

== What Is GitHub Actions?

But first, let me introduce Terraform.
Terraform is...

== Generating a Simple Quarkus Application

First of all, let's generate a simple Quarkus application.
This application exposes a RestEndpoint that says "Hello NubesGen".
Nothing too fancy, but this allows us to focus on the deployment, not the code.

=== Bootstrapping a Quarkus Application

Go to https://xxx[code.quarkus.io], specify your project name, group and artifact id, and select the Rest Easy extension.
Download the Zip file.
This is what you should have:

```
code
```

Now, to execute it, type `mvn quarkus:dev`.
Once Quarkus is up and ready, invoke the endpoint pointing at the URL ``.

=== Updating the Generated Code

Let's change the generated code so our REST endpoint returns _Hello NubesGen_ with a timestamp:

.Rest Endpoint
[source,java]
----
include::{code-github-url}/src/main/java/org/agoncal/article/nubesgen/terraform/GreetingResource.java[tag=adocSnippet]
----

And if we want the tests to pass, it's just a matter of changing the RESTAssured test:

.Testing the Rest Endpoint
[source,java]
----
include::{code-github-url}/src/test/java/org/agoncal/article/nubesgen/terraform/GreetingResourceTest.java[tag=adocSnippet]
----

That's enough business code, time to package and deploy the application.

=== Packaging the Application

We've just executed Quarkus in development mode.
What we need now is to package the application.
Quarkus has different ways of packaging an application:
as a Docker image, a native binary (thanks to GraalVM) or as an executable JAR.
Let's go for this option now, it's simple and portable.

To get a Uber-JAR of the application, execute the following command:

```
mvn package
```

To run the application is just a matter of executing:

```
mvn package
```

=== Executing the Application

Now that we have built the executable JAR, running the application is just a matter of executing:

[source,bash]
----
$ java -jar target/quarkus-nubesgen-terraform-1.0.0-SNAPSHOT-runner.jar
----

Once Quarkus is up and running, execute the following cURL command, you should see our _Hello NubesGen_:

[source,bash]
----
$ curl http://localhost:8080/hello

Hello NubesGen 2021-07-07T14:21:54.314396Z
----

== Generating the Terraform and GitHub Actions Configuration Files with NubesGen

We have a simple application, with no database, no authentication, nothing, packaged in an executable Uber-JAR.
Let's ask NubesGen to generate the Terraform templates.

.Generating Terraform and GitHub Actions Files with a cURL Command
[source,bash]
----
$ curl "https://nubesgen.com/quarkus-nubesgen-github-actions.tgz?iactool=TERRAFORM&region=northeurope&application=APP_SERVICE.free&runtime=QUARKUS&database=NONE.free&gitops=true" | tar -xzvf -
----

=== Main Terraform Template

=== Application Terraform Template

== Deploying the Application

=== Execute the Terraform Templates

== Checking the Application on Azure

First of all, we need to check if our REST endpoint is responding.
For that, we use the URL that was displayed once the plan executed, and add our `hello` path:

[source,bash]
----
$ curl https://app-quarkus-nubesgen-terraform-001.azurewebsites.net/hello
----

Good!
The REST endpoint replies _Hello NubesGen_, so it's up and running.
Let's check the Azure console.

=== Checking the Azure Console

If you want to have a look at what's deployed, one way is to go to the Azure portal.
For that, go to https://portal.azure.com and check the resources.
You should see the application as well as the plan:

=== Checking with the Azure CLI

== Conclusion

Terraform can be tricky.
Its language is simple, but because Terraforma has an extension mecanism, its ecosystem is huge.
You can find extension for Java, for AWS, for GCP... and for Azure.
Deploying to the cloud, even a simple application, can take you a few lines of code to write.

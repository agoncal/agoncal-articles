# qute-panache Project

Code for the article [A Qute Way to Visualise Data with Panache](https://antoniogoncalves.org/2021/01/12/merry-chistmas-and-happy-fallback-with-microprofile).

## Running the Sample

The idea is to start the Quarkus application and visualise the data.
For that, you need Docker to be up and running.
This sample uses a PostgreSQL database with TestContainers (DevServices in fact).
So it needs to pull the PostgreSQL image and execute it.

### Starting the app

### Invoking the microservices through cURL commands

In this blog post I'll show you how develop a Quarkus application to easily access your relational database (using _Hibernate ORM with Panache_) and display its content in HTML with _Qute_ templates.
To break it into more details you will learn:

* What is _Hibernate ORM with Panache_?
* How to access a relational database with _Hibernate ORM with Panache_.
* What is Qute templates?
* How to display the data from the database in HTML using _Qute_ templates.
* Beautify the _Qute_ templates with Tweeter Bootstrap.

== Use Case

Let's say you have a relational database storing a list of books, and your users want a visual interface to query the list of books as well as see the details of a book.
There are several tools you can choose from... but have you thought of developing it with Quarkus?
Quarkus allows you to easily access relational databases, thanks to https://quarkus.io/guides/hibernate-orm-panache[Hibernate ORM with Panache], as well has using templating thanks to https://quarkus.io/guides/qute[Qute].

The diagram below shows the overall architecture of what will be detailed in this blog post:

* The `Book` entity is a Panache entity mapped to a PostgreSQL database (with a `Book` table).
* The `BookPage` is a Qute resource (a JAX-RS endpoint with some Qute specific APIs) that uses two templates (`book.html` and `books.html`) to display the list of books and the detail of one book.
* `base.html` is a base Qute template, included in the two others, where we'll add Tweeter Bootstrap.

== Accessing the Database with Hibernate ORM with Panache

In Java, we have several APIs and frameworks to map objects to relational databases.
One of these famous frameworks is https://hibernate.org/[Hibernate] which implements the https://jakarta.ee/specifications/persistence/[JPA] specification.
Hibernate makes mapping and querying Java objects easy.
_Hibernate ORM with Panache_ is built on top of Hibernate, and makes simple mapping and simple queries trivial.

=== Panache Entity

To store books into a relational database we use a `Book` Panache entity.
Like a standard JPA entity, `Book` is annotated with `@Entity` and can use other JPA annotations (eg. `@Table`, `@Column`, etc.).
One difference though, is that Panache entities extend either `PanacheEntity` (and therefore get an identifier) or `PanacheBaseEntity` (and therefore manage their own identifier).

image::2021-06-book.png[]

The code below shows the `Book` Panache entity.
As you can see, there is no `@Id` annotation for the identifier because we inherit the one defined in the super class `PanacheEntity`.
It is annotated with `@Entity` and uses `@Table` to specify the name of the table where to map books, as well as `@Column` to map to specific columns.
One difference with straight JPA entities, is that all attributes can be public, and getters and setters become optional.

[source,java]
----
@Entity
@Table(name = "t_books")
public class Book extends PanacheEntity {

  @Column(length = 100, nullable = false)
  public String title;

  @Column(length = 20)
  public String isbn;

  @Column(nullable = false)
  public BigDecimal price;

  // ....
----

=== Active Record Pattern

By inheriting from `PanacheBaseEntity`, our `Book` entity benefits from many methods allowing CRUD operations and queries.
This is known as the https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Active_record_pattern[Active Record Pattern].
This allows you to do the following:

[source,java]
----
Book.findById(id);
Book.findByIdOptional(id);
Book.deleteById(id);
Book.deleteAll();
Book.count();
----

That's for CRUD operations, but `PanacheBaseEntity` also has a set of methods to query entities, sort and paginate them:

[source,java]
----
Book.list(query);
Book.find(query).list();
Book.find(query, Sort.by(sort)).list();
Book.find(query, Sort.by(sort)).page(pageIndex, pageSize).list();
----

_Hibernate ORM with Panache_ also simplifies the _Java Persistence Query Language_ (JPQL) defined in JPA.
It allows you to write queries without the `SELECT` and `FROM` clause.
You only concentrate on the `WHERE` clause (without having to use the `WHERE` keyword):

[source,java]
----
Book.list("price < 10", Sort.by("isbn"));
Book.list("price < 10 and nbOfPages > 100");
Book.list("price < 10 and nbOfPages > 100", Sort.by("isbn"));
Book.find("price < 10 and nbOfPages > 100", Sort.by("isbn")).list();
Book.find("price < 10 and nbOfPages > 100", Sort.by("isbn")).page(2, 4).list();
----

== Visualising Data with Qute

Now that we have a `Book` entity with methods to query it, let's add a few _Qute_ resources to visualize the list of books and the details of a book.
_Qute_ is _yet another templating engine_ that fits well with Quarkus.
The Quarkus documentation specifies that:

[quote]
_Qute_ is a templating engine designed specifically to meet the Quarkus needs.
The usage of reflection is minimized to reduce the size of native images.
The API combines both the imperative and the non-blocking reactive style of coding.

=== Declaring the Qute Templates

There are different ways to declare _Qute_ templates, but I quite like the https://quarkus.io/guides/qute#type-safe-templates[type safe way].
The idea is to create a _Qute_ resource (here called `BookPage`) and define the templates with code.
In the example below, we defined two templates called `book()` and `books()`.

Notice that these methods can take parameters.
The `book()` method takes a `book` object so it can access the attributes of a `book` and display them in HTML.
As for `books()`, it takes a list of books that the template will iterate through and display.

[source,java]
----
@Path("/page/books")
@Produces(MediaType.TEXT_HTML)
@ApplicationScoped
public class BookPage {

  @CheckedTemplate
  public static class Templates {
    public static native TemplateInstance book(Book book);
    public static native TemplateInstance books(List<Book> books);
  }
  // ...
----

The type-safe approach relies on some conventions.
The _Qute_ templates must have the same name as defined in the code (eg. `book()` for `book.html`).
Then, they must be located under the `/src/main/resources/templates` directory, under a sub-directory named after the _Qute_ resource (here `BookPage`).

=== Displaying the Book Details

To display the details of a book, we now need to create a method that accesses the database giving a book identifier.
In the `BookPage` resource, notice the `showBookById()` method.
It uses JAX-RS annotations (`@GET`, `@Path`, `@PathParam("id")`) so it can handle an HTTP request such as http://localhost:8080/page/books/2.
Notice how `Book.findById(id)` uses the _Active Record pattern_ to get the `Book` entity by its identifier.

[source,java]
----
@Path("/page/books")
@Produces(MediaType.TEXT_HTML)
@ApplicationScoped
public class BookPage {

  @CheckedTemplate
  public static class Templates {
    public static native TemplateInstance book(Book book);
  }

  @GET
  @Path("/{id}")
  public TemplateInstance showBookById(@PathParam("id") Long id) {
    return Templates.book(Book.findById(id));
  }
  // ...
----

Once the book is found, it is returned withing the `book()` template.
The _Qute_ engine will then look for the template under `src/main/resources/templates/BookPage/book.html` and pass the `book` object as a parameter.
The `book.html` file below is quite simple.
it uses an expression language to access the attribute of the `book` object:
`{book.id}` accesses the `id` attribute of the `book` object that was passed in `Templates.book(Book.findById(id))`.

[source,html]
----
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
  <meta charset="UTF-8">
  <title>Book</title>
</head>
<body>
  Id: {book.id}
  Title: {book.title}
  Description: {book.description}
  Price: {book.price}
  Isbn: {book.isbn}
  Number of Pages: {book.nbOfPages}
  Publication Date: {book.publicationDate}
  Created Date: {book.createdDate}
</body>
</html>
----

=== Displaying the List of Books

To display the list of books, we need to query them.
And that's when Panache makes life easy.
The `showAllBooks()` method takes the needed parameters to execute a query with sort and pagination.
So, for example, if you invoke the `showAllBooks()` with the following HTTP request:

```
http://localhost:8080/page/books?query=price < 50 and nbOfPages > 100 &sort=isbn&page=1&size=5
```

It will execute the following Panache query:

```
Book.find("price < 50 and nbOfPages > 100", Sort.by("isbn")).page(1, 5))
```

[source,java]
----
@Path("/page/books")
@Produces(MediaType.TEXT_HTML)
@ApplicationScoped
public class BookPage {

  @CheckedTemplate
  public static class Templates {
    public static native TemplateInstance books(List<Book> books);
  }

  @GET
  public TemplateInstance showAllBooks(
          @QueryParam("query") String query,
          @QueryParam("sort") @DefaultValue("id") String sort,
          @QueryParam("page") @DefaultValue("0") Integer pageIndex,
          @QueryParam("size") @DefaultValue("1000") Integer pageSize) {
    return Templates.books(Book.find(query, Sort.by(sort)).page(pageIndex, pageSize).list())
      .data("query", query)
      .data("sort", sort)
      .data("pageIndex", pageIndex)
      .data("pageSize", pageSize);
  }
  // ...
----

Notice that when we invoke the `books()` template, we pass the list of books returned by the query, but we also add the parameters to the template (eg. `data("sort", sort)`).
This is another way to pass data to the template.

The template loops through the list of books (`{#for book in books}`) and displays the attributed (`{book.isbn}`, `{book.id}`).
To display the data that was passed to the template (`data("sort", sort)`) we use the special `data` namespace (`{data:sort}`).

[source,html]
----
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
  <meta charset="UTF-8">
  <title>Books</title>
</head>
<body>
<code>Book.find({data:query}, Sort.by({data:sort})).page({data:pageIndex}, {data:pageSize}).list()</code>
<table>
  <thead>
  <tr>
    <th scope="col">#</th>
    <th scope="col">Title</th>
    <th scope="col">Isbn</th>
    <th scope="col">Price</th>
    <th scope="col">n° Pages</th>
    <th scope="col">Publication Date</th>
  </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
  {#for book in books}
    <tr>
      <th scope="row"><a href="http://localhost:8080/page/books/{book.id}">{book.id}</a></th>
      <td>{book.title}</td>
      <td>{book.isbn}</td>
      <td>{book.price}</td>
      <td>{book.nbOfPages}</td>
      <td>{book.publicationDate}</td>
    </tr>
  {/for}
  </tbody>
</table>
</body>
</html>
----

=== Beautifying the Templates

To beautify these two templates, we can use a base template that both will inherit from, and add some Tweeter Bootstrap.
That's what the `base.html` does.
It also uses an `#insert` section used to specify parts that could be overridden by the child templates:
here, the title (`{#insert title}`) and the body (`{#insert body}`) of the included template:

[source,html]
----
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
  <meta charset="UTF-8">
  <link href="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.0.1/dist/css/bootstrap.min.css" rel="stylesheet"
        integrity="sha384-+0n0xVW2eSR5OomGNYDnhzAbDsOXxcvSN1TPprVMTNDbiYZCxYbOOl7+AMvyTG2x" crossorigin="anonymous">
  <title>{#insert title}Default Title{/}</title>
</head>
<body>
<div class="container">
  <h1>{#insert title}Default Title{/}</h1>
  {#insert body}No body!{/}
</div>
</body>
</html>
----

To include the `base.html` template in the `book.html` and `books.html` templates, it is just a matter of including it (`{#include base.html}`) and overriding the specific sections (`{#title}{/title}` and `{#body}{/body}`).

[source,html]
----
{#include base.html}
{#title}{books.size} Books{/title}
{#body}
  <!-- body -->
{/body}
{/include}
----

== Executing

To execute the code, you need Docker to be up and running.
Why?
Because the data is stored into a PostgreSQL database and we use the Quarkus DevServices to automatically start it.
The way https://quarkus.io/guides/datasource#devservices-configuration-free-databases[DevServices] works, is that it detects that the application needs a PostgreSQL database (because it is declared as a dependency in the `pom.xml`) and uses TestContainers behind the scenes, to download the Docker image, start and stop it.

[source,xml]
----
<dependency>
  <groupId>io.quarkus</groupId>
  <artifactId>quarkus-jdbc-postgresql</artifactId>
</dependency>
----

This happens just by starting Quarkus with the following command:

```
$ mvn quarkus:dev
```

Then, you can point your browser to the following URLs so you can query the database and display different lists of books:

[source,term]
----
http://localhost:8080/page/books?query=price < 10
http://localhost:8080/page/books?query=price < 10 and nbOfPages > 100 &sort=isbn
http://localhost:8080/page/books?query=price < 50 and nbOfPages > 100 &sort=isbn&page=1&size=5
http://localhost:8080/page/books?query=price < 50 and nbOfPages > 100 &sort=isbn&page=2&size=5
----

To get the details of a book, you can use the following URLs:

[source,term]
----
http://localhost:8080/page/book/1
http://localhost:8080/page/book/2
----

== Conclusion

There are several ways to easily display data from the database.
In this blog post I wanted to show you the combination of _Qute_ and _Hibernate ORM with Panache_.
_Qute_ is a templating engine, so its main purpose is not to be _yet another front-end framework_.
You can use _Qute_ templates to write emails, send messages, etc.
But writing HTML pages is also doable.

As for _Hibernate ORM with Panache_, it is a great way to make easy queries trivial.
Remember that _Hibernate ORM with Panache_ is built on top of JPA.
So if you need the power of JPA, you can.
By inheriting from `PanacheEntity` you get access to the JPA `EntityManager` and can use it whenever you want.
You are not stuck to _Hibernate ORM with Panache_, you also have the full powser of JPA.
